Benefit-risk assessment of statins: different analyses for different decisions (working title)
===

- TODO: figure out a better title (All)

Abstract
---
abstract here

Introduction
---
- TODO: Describe the different treatment decisions - prescribing and treatment decisions in clinical practice, and broader policy decisions such as drug approval and HTA (Huseyin) NOTE/Tommi: I would consider leaving HTA out of this paper - taking the cost aspect into account makes it more complicated. NOTE/Douwe: I agree.

An introduction explaining the challenges in decision making for different healthcare settings that mainly arise due to methodological gaps in synthesis and interpretation of evidence. Settings include drug and treatment selection, marketing authorisation, coverage/reimbursement.
Highlight the case of prescribing and treatment selection while choosing it as the topic of the case study.

- TODO: Describe the statins case (Huseyin / ?)

Methods
---

### Alternatives and criteria ###
- TODO: describe the decision problem

### Criteria measurements ###
- TODO: Describe the statins data set (Huseyin)

### Preference modeling ###
- TODO: Describe MAVT (Tommi)
- TODO: Describe different elicitation methods (Gert, Tommi, Douwe, ++?)
- TODO: Describe SMAA (Tommi)

Results
---
- TODO: Results of preference elicitation from some "experts" using different elicitation techniques (?)
- NOTE/Tommi: need to elicit piecewise partial value functions (bisection?), weight ranges (interval swing), and the MAVT parameterization using indirect techniques
- NOTE/Tommi: I guess we will make the case analysis using policy/prescription decision preferences, and discuss later on what would be the differences/challenges when trying to model population preferences?
- Results from a SMAA analysis, using (i) linear partial VF and (ii) piecewise linear partial VFs

Discussion
---
- TODO: Describe the pros and cons of MAUT (Tommi and Douwe)
