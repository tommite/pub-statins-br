Benefit-risk assessment of statins: different analyses for different decisions (working title)
===

- TODO: figure out a better title (All)

Abstract
---
abstract here

Introduction
---
- TODO: Describe the different treatment decisions - prescribing and treatment decisions in clinical practice, and broader policy decisions such as drug approval and HTA (Huseyin) NOTE/Tommi: I would consider leaving HTA out of this paper - taking the cost aspect into account makes it more complicated.

- TODO: Describe the statins case (Huseyin / ?)

Methods
---

### Network meta-analysis ###
- TODO: Describe network MA (Gert)

### Preference modeling ###
- TODO: Describe MAVT (Tommi)
- TODO: Describe extension to MAUT (Tommi)
- TODO: Describe why MAUT might not be the best option (Tommi and Douwe)
- TODO: Describe SMAA (Tommi)
- TODO: Describe different elicitation methods (Gert, Tommi, Douwe, ++?)

Results
---
- TODO: Describe the statins data set (Huseyin)
- TODO: Results of preference elicitation from some "experts" using different elicitation techniques (?)
- NOTE/Tommi: need to elicit piecewise partial value functions (bisection?), weight ranges (interval swing), risk attitude (SG?), and the MAVT parameterization using indirect techniques
- NOTE/Tommi: I guess we will make the case analysis using policy/prescription decision preferences, and discuss later on what would be the differences/challenges when trying to model population preferences?
- NOTE/Tommi: we could also skip MAUT in this paper completely and just explain that risk attitude is too difficult to elicit (and prone to too many biases, there's tons of papers on the topic)
- Results from a SMAA analysis, using (i) linear partial VFs, (ii) piecewise linear partial VFs, and (iii) utility functions
