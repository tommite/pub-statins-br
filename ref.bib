  abstract = {{Background: Sertraline and fluoxetine have pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic
	differences, which may be of clinical relevance. Method: A randomized,
	double-blind, parallel-group study of 6 weeks' duration comparing
	the efficacy and safety of sertraline (50-100 mg/day) with those
	of fluoxetine (20-40 mg/day) was conducted in 286 psychiatric outpatients
	with DSM-III-R major depression or bipolar disorder (depressed).
	Primary efficacy measurements consisted of the 17-item Hamilton Rating
	Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Clinical Global Impressions
	(CGI) scale. Secondary measurements included the Hamilton Rating
	Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Raskin Depression Scale, the Covi
	Anxiety Scale, and the Leeds Sleep Questionnaire. Additionally, scores
	for two items and five factors from the HAM-D were analyzed. Results:
	Efficacy was based on 124 evaluable patients in each treatment group.
	As measured by HAM-D and CGI-Severity scores, there was a significant
	(p < .001) improvement from baseline to each follow-up visit in both
	treatment groups with no statistically significant difference between
	groups. There was also no significant difference in the proportion
	of responders in each group. CGI-Improvement responder rates were
	69\% for sertraline and 67\% for fluoxetine. Results of secondary
	efficacy measurements followed the same trend, although from the
	second week of treatment there was a numerical advantage (not statistically
	significant) for sertraline over fluoxetine in improving anxiety
	symptoms as measured by the total HAM-A score. Headache and nausea
	were the most frequently reported events for both drugs. The incidence
	of early patient withdrawals due to treatment-emergent adverse events
	was 14\% for sertraline and 13\% for fluoxetine. The starting dosage
	(sertraline 50 mg/day, fluoxetine 20 mg/day) was the final dosage
	in 76\% of patients in both treatment groups. Conclusion: Sertraline
	and fluoxetine were equally effective and well tolerated in patients
	with major depression and associated anxiety.}},

  abstract = {{Background Meta-analyses are now widely used to provide evidence
	to support clinical strategies. However, large randomized, controlled
	trials are considered the gold standard in evaluating the efficacy
	of clinical interventions. Methods We compared the results of large
	randomized, controlled trials (involving 1000 patients or more) that
	were published in four journals (the New England Journal of Medicine,
	the Lancet, the Annals of Internal Medicine, and the Journal of the
	American Medical Association) with the results of meta-analyses published
	earlier on the same topics. Regarding the principal and secondary
	outcomes, we judged whether the findings of the randomized trials
	agreed with those of the corresponding meta-analyses, and we determined
	whether the study results were positive (indicating that treatment
	improved the outcome) or negative (indicating that the outcome with
	treatment was the same or worse than without it) at the conventional
	level of statistical significance (P<0.05). Results We identified
	12 large randomized, controlled trials and 19 meta-analyses addressing
	the same questions. For a total of 40 primary and secondary outcomes,
	agreement between the meta-analyses and the large clinical trials
	was only fair (kappa = 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.06
	to 0.64). The positive predictive value of the meta-analyses was
	68 percent, and the negative predictive value 67 percent. However,
	the difference in point estimates between the randomized trials and
	the meta-analyses was statistically significant for only 5 of the
	40 comparisons (12 percent). Furthermore, in each case of disagreement
	a statistically significant effect of treatment was found by one
	method, whereas no statistically significant effect was found by
	the other. Conclusions The outcomes of the 12 large randomized, controlled
	trials that we studied were not predicted accurately 35 percent of
	the time by the meta-analyses published previously on the same topics.

  abstract = {{Expenditures for prescription drugs continue to increase, prompting
	insurers and health systems to adopt formulary or coverage policies
	restricting the use of more expensive drugs. Those establishing formulary
	policies face a complex array of claims regarding differences in
	efficacy, safety, treatment cost, or cost-effectiveness. We describe
	and illustrate 5 specific principles for applying research evidence
	to formulary decisions: (1) Experimental data should take precedence
	over models or simulations, and assumptions of such models should
	be carefully examined. (2) Morbidity or mortality outcomes should
	take precedence over surrogate or intermediate outcomes. (3) Claims
	for advantages of new treatments should consider the full range of
	alternatives rather than those selected by industry. (4) Variation
	in effects across individuals or subgroups argue against restrictions
	on first-line treatment, but only if those differences are predictable.
	(5) Variation in effects argues against requiring changes in ongoing
	treatment. We also discuss how economic incentives are likely to
	influence selection of research questions, especially research related
	to drug-gene interactions and to identifying new indications for
	existing drugs.}},
