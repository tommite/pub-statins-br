## Abstract ##

Decisions at many levels of health care have to weigh the pros and cons of alternative treatment strategies, including drug marketing authorization, reimbursement policy setting, guideline formulation, and prescription.
While these decisions differ in some important respects, they also have much in common: they involve trade-offs between multiple effects measured on different scales, they should all be based on the best available evidence (often randomized controlled trials), and they must deal with significant uncertainty around treatment effects.
Given the challenging nature of such decisions it is not surprising that multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), a family of formal methods that help decision makers structure these problems, is increasingly receiving attention in the field of medical decision making.

TODO: some linkage here.
In this paper, we survey different types of preference information and how they apply in either population-level or individualized treatment decisions.
Moreoves, we discuss how such preference information should be elicited from expert decision makers or patients in a meaningful way that limits the chances of obtaining biased preference information.
We hope to make decision makers and researchers aware of the various tools available to them, and the situations in which each tool is most suited.

## Introduction ##

Many decisions in health care involve assessing the balance of favourable and unfavourable effects of alternative treatment regimens, taking into account the associated uncertainties [CITE].
For example, regulatory authorities assess whether a new drug is expected to, on balance, do more good than harm when treating a condition in a specific target population [CITE].
Many have suggested the use of some form of multiple criteria decision analysis in regulatory benefit-risk assessments [@holden2003;@mussen2007;@felli2009;@smaa-br;@network-br;@coplan2011], including the European Medicines Agency's own benefit-risk project [@ema-br-wp2].
The scope of regulatory benefit-risk assessment is usually fairly limited in the sense that the evidence base consists solely of the clinical trials submitted by the applicant [CITE] and the number of comparators is small because the objective is usually to ensure that the drug is beneficial as compared to not treating the condition, rather than to identify the best treatment [CITE].
The formulation of treatment guidelines depends on a similar process of benefit-risk deliberation, although in this case the analysis will be much more inclusive in terms of both evidence and the number of comparators, since the goal is to identify the best treatment option given the available evidence [CITE].
In addition, guideline formulation may also focus on identifying sub-populations that respond particularly well or particularly badly to specific treatments, and will also take into account the feasibility of implementing each treatment in the given health care setting [CITE].
Prescribers often depend on guidelines and experience when identifying the best treatment for a specific patient, but may also refer to systematic reviews or directly to clinical trials [CITE].
In essence, the prescription problem is similar to the regulatory benefit-risk problem, with two important differences: (1) the decision should take into account the individual patient's preferences rather than determine what is acceptable at the population level and (2) it may be questioned whether the population-level evidence from clinical trials or systematic reviews thereof applies to the individual patient [CITE huseyin-mcda?].
Reimbursement decisions typically include several different aspects, including an assessment similar to the regulatory benefit-risk assessment and a cost-effectiveness analysis that contrasts long-term health effects versus the long-term costs of a treatment [CITE].
Cost-effectiveness analysis is interesting in that it often includes preferences at two different levels: the policy maker's preferences for health care spending versus health benefits and the patients' preferences expressed as health state utilities.
Although it can be argued that the standard cost-effectiveness framework is a form of MCDA [@smaa-cea] and so is the Quality Adjusted Life Year [CITE], the focus of this paper is on the benefit-risk type of decision rather than on the health economic setting.
This enables a unified focus on decisions involving trade-offs between multiple criteria that are directly expressed by the relevant expert(s) or patient.

 - TODO: An introduction explaining the challenges in decision making for different healthcare settings that mainly arise due to methodological gaps in synthesis and interpretation of evidence. Settings include drug and treatment selection, marketing authorisation, coverage/reimbursement.

 - TODO: Highlight the case of prescribing and treatment selection while choosing it as the topic of the case study.

 - TODO: Describe the statins case (Huseyin / ?)

## Methods ##

### Alternatives and criteria ###

 - TODO: describe the decision problem

### Criteria measurements ###

 - TODO: Describe the statins data set (Huseyin)

### Preference modeling ###

 - TODO: Describe MAVT (Tommi)
 - TODO: Discuss differences in modeling individual / population preferences (?)
 - TODO: Describe different elicitation methods (Gert, Tommi, Douwe, ++?)
 - TODO: Describe SMAA (Tommi)

## Results ##

 - TODO: Results of preference elicitation from some "experts" using different elicitation techniques (?)
 - NOTE/Tommi: need to elicit piecewise partial value functions (bisection?), weight ranges (interval swing), and the MAVT parameterization using indirect techniques
 - NOTE/Tommi: I guess we will make the case analysis using policy/prescription decision preferences, and discuss later on what would be the differences/challenges when trying to model population preferences?
 - Results from a SMAA analysis, using (i) linear partial VF and (ii) piecewise linear partial VFs, with different accuracy of the preferences

## Discussion ##

 - TODO: Describe why we did not apply MAUT / the cons of MAUT (Tommi and Douwe)
 - TODO: policy implications, mainly for prescribing and treatment selections, but possibly also touching on the other settings we introduced at the beginning (Huseyin and Aris)
